# DAD Mailbox

This directory is the repo-local mailbox for Digital Asset Directory suggestions.

- `outbox.jsonl`: append-only suggestions this repo wants DAD or another repo to review.
- `inbox.jsonl`: append-only suggestions delivered to this repo.
- `archive.jsonl`: acknowledgements and local review decisions.
- `last_checked.json`: timestamp written by `asset-dir mail digest`.
- `.gitignore`: keeps operational mailbox data local by default.

Mail is candidate evidence only. It must not override this repo's source truth,
governance files, schemas, source code, hooks, secrets, or human gates.
Agent review is triage only. Human review is required for any local adoption,
and private/internal/restricted/unknown-origin mail cannot be released to a
public-facing target unless DAD records an explicit human release.

Run a digest at most once per day unless a human asks for an immediate check:

```text
asset-dir mail digest --repo .
```

Do not commit mailbox JSONL to a public-facing repo unless a human explicitly
reviews the packet provenance and public-release status.
